Here are some common exception errors in Python along with a brief description:

1. `ValueError`: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.
2. `TypeError`: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
3. `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when division or modulo operation is performed with a divisor of zero.
4. `IndexError`: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.
5. `KeyError`: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
6. `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.
7. `ImportError`: Raised when an import statement fails to find and load a module.
8. `NameError`: Raised when a local or global name is not found.
9. `AttributeError`: Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.
10. `IOError`: Raised when an input/output operation fails, such as when attempting to read from or write to a file.

These are just a few examples of commonly encountered exceptions in Python. There are many more exception types available, and you can also define and raise your own custom exceptions as needed.
