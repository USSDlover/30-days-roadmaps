Here's an example of how to define and raise a custom exception in Python:

```python
class CustomException(Exception):
    pass

def divide_numbers(num1, num2):
    if num2 == 0:
        raise CustomException("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        return num1 / num2

try:
    result = divide_numbers(10, 0)
    print("Result:", result)
except CustomException as e:
    print(e)
```

In this example, we define a custom exception called `CustomException`, which inherits from the base `Exception` class. The `CustomException` class does not have any additional functionality, as it simply uses the `pass` statement.

We then define a function called `divide_numbers()` that takes two numbers as input. If the second number (`num2`) is zero, we raise the `CustomException` with an appropriate error message. Otherwise, we perform the division and return the result.

Within the `try` block, we call the `divide_numbers()` function with the arguments `10` and `0`, which will cause the custom exception to be raised. The exception is caught by the `except` block, and the error message is printed.

By defining and raising custom exceptions, you can create more specific and meaningful error handling for your application, allowing you to handle exceptional scenarios that are specific to your program's requirements.
