## Common Plots

1. **Line Plot**: A line plot shows the relationship between two variables by connecting data points with straight lines. It is useful for displaying trends or changes over time. For example, you can use a line plot to visualize the stock prices of a company over a month.

2. **Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot displays individual data points as dots on a graph. It is used to show the relationship between two continuous variables. Scatter plots can reveal patterns, clusters, or correlations in the data. For instance, you can create a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between a student's study time and their test scores.

3. **Bar Plot**: A bar plot represents data using rectangular bars of different heights. It is suitable for comparing categorical data or discrete quantities. Bar plots are commonly used to show the distribution of data across different categories or to compare values between different groups. For example, you can use a bar plot to compare the sales performance of different products.

4. **Histogram**: A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It consists of a series of bins along an axis, with the height of each bin representing the frequency or count of data falling within that bin. Histograms are useful for understanding the shape and spread of data. They can help identify patterns, such as whether the data is skewed or follows a normal distribution.

5. **Pie Chart**: A pie chart divides a circle into sectors, where each sector represents a proportion or percentage of a whole. Pie charts are commonly used to display the composition or distribution of categorical data. They are useful for visualizing the relative sizes of different categories or showing the percentage breakdown of a dataset.

6. **Box Plot**: A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) displays the distribution of numerical data through quartiles. It shows the minimum, maximum, median, and interquartile range of a dataset, along with any outliers. Box plots are effective for comparing multiple groups or variables and identifying skewness, outliers, or variability in the data.

7. **Heatmap**: A heatmap uses color-coded cells to represent values in a matrix or a table. It is particularly useful for visualizing relationships or patterns in large datasets. Heatmaps are commonly used in areas like correlation analysis, genomics, and geographic information systems (GIS).

These are just a few examples of plots used in data visualization. Each plot type serves a specific purpose and can provide valuable insights into your data. Choosing the right plot depends on the nature of your data and the insights you want to convey.
