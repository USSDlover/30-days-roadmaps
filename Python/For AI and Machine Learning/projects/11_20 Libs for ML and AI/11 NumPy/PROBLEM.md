Problem: Analyzing Sales Data

You work for a retail company and have been provided with sales data for different products in multiple regions. Your task is to analyze the sales data to gain insights into the performance of the products and regions.

The sales data is given as a CSV file, where each row represents a sale and contains information such as product name, region, quantity sold, and revenue generated.

Using NumPy, write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

1. Read the sales data from the CSV file into a NumPy array.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated by each product.
3. Determine the top-selling product based on the total quantity sold.
4. Calculate the average revenue generated per region.
5. Identify the region with the highest total revenue.

This real-world problem will require you to use NumPy's array manipulation, indexing, and aggregation capabilities to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the sales data. You can further extend the program to perform additional calculations or visualizations based on the specific requirements of the retail company.

Good luck with analyzing the sales data using NumPy!
