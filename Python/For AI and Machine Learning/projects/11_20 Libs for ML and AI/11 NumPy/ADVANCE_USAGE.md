Here are a few advanced level usages of NumPy with examples:

1. **Array Broadcasting**: NumPy allows you to perform operations between arrays of different shapes, a concept known as
   broadcasting. Broadcasting enables efficient element-wise operations without having to create explicit loops. Here's
   an example:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   # Create a 1D array
   a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
   
   # Create a 2D array
   b = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
   
   # Perform element-wise multiplication using broadcasting
   result = a * b
   
   print(result)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   [[ 4  8 12]
    [ 5 10 15]
    [ 6 12 18]]
   ```

   In this example, the 1D array `a` and the 2D array `b` have different shapes, but NumPy automatically broadcasts the
   arrays to perform element-wise multiplication, resulting in a 2D array `result`.

2. **Array Indexing and Slicing**: NumPy provides powerful indexing and slicing capabilities to access and manipulate
   array elements. You can use indexing and slicing to extract specific elements, rows, or columns from an array. Here's
   an example:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   # Create a 2D array
   arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])
   
   # Access a specific element
   print(arr[1, 2])  # Output: 6
   
   # Slice rows and columns
   print(arr[:, 1])     # Output: [2 5 8]
   print(arr[1:, :2])   # Output: [[4 5]
                        #          [7 8]]
   ```

   In this example, indexing is used to access the element at the second row and third column (`arr[1, 2]`). Slicing is
   used to extract the second column (`arr[:, 1]`) and a subarray of the original array (`arr[1:, :2]`).

3. **Array Manipulation**: NumPy provides various functions to manipulate arrays, such as reshaping, stacking,
   splitting, and more. These functions allow you to reshape arrays, combine multiple arrays, split arrays, and perform
   other operations. Here's an example:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   # Create a 1D array
   a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
   
   # Reshape the array to a 2D matrix
   b = np.reshape(a, (2, 3))
   
   # Split the array into multiple subarrays
   c, d = np.split(b, 2)
   
   print(a)
   print(b)
   print(c)
   print(d)
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   [1 2 3 4 5 6]
   [[1 2 3]
    [4 5 6]]
   [[1 2 3]]
   [[4 5 6]]
   ```

   In this example, the `np.reshape()` function is used to reshape the 1D array `a` into a 2D matrix `b`. Then,
   the `np.split()` function is used to split `b` into two subarrays `c` and `d`.

These are just a few examples of advanced usage with NumPy. NumPy provides a wide range of functionalities for numerical

computations, including linear algebra operations, statistical functions, random number generation, and more. You can
