Here's a challenge for you to practice your Pandas skills:

**Problem:** You have been provided with a dataset containing information about customer orders from an online store. The dataset includes columns such as customer ID, order ID, order date, product ID, quantity, and price. Your task is to perform the following tasks using Pandas:

1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Explore the data and identify any missing values or inconsistencies.
3. Clean the data by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
4. Calculate the total revenue generated by each customer.
5. Identify the top 5 customers who made the highest number of orders.
6. Find the products that were frequently purchased together (i.e., appeared in the same order).
7. Determine the month with the highest revenue and visualize the monthly revenue trend.
8. Calculate the average price and quantity of products sold.

Your goal is to use Pandas to analyze the dataset, extract meaningful insights, and present your findings in a clear and concise manner.

Remember to break down the problem into smaller steps, use appropriate Pandas functions and methods, and leverage data manipulation and analysis techniques to solve the challenge. Good luck!
