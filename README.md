# 30-Day Learning Roadmaps for New Technologies

Welcome to the 30-Day Learning Roadmaps repository! This repository aims to provide curated learning roadmaps for various technologies, enabling you to learn and master new skills within a 30-day timeframe. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these roadmaps will guide you through a structured learning path to help you gain proficiency in your chosen technology.

## How to Use

Each technology-specific roadmap is organized into daily learning tasks or milestones, allowing you to make progress incrementally over 30 days. You can choose a roadmap that aligns with your interests and goals, and follow the daily tasks outlined in the roadmap.

In each roadmap folder, you'll find the following structure:

- `README.md`: This file contains the 30-day roadmap with daily tasks, resources, and learning materials.
- `resources/`: This folder contains additional resources such as tutorials, documentation, books, and video courses that supplement the learning roadmap.
- `projects/`: This folder includes optional project ideas or exercises that you can work on to apply your newly acquired knowledge.

Feel free to explore different technologies and select the roadmaps that intrigue you the most. Adapt the learning pace to fit your schedule, and don't hesitate to dive deeper into specific topics if you find them particularly interesting or challenging.
